# DESCRIPTION

RecRun takes the work out of managing attendance for recurring recreational sports events. Event managers add players in the app and create events, set minimum and maximum player numbers. Then, with the click of a button, the app will text message players with the invite.

Players can respond to the RSVP deadline with a simple 'YES', 'NO' or 'MAYBE'--and even change their minds (before the RSVP deadline!). Managers can quickly see who's responded, send reminders and message players. They can also view attendance history for each player.
