# RecRun

RecRun takes the work out of managing attendance for recurring recreational sports events. Event managers add players in the app and create events. RecRun then takes care of inviting attendees via text message and managing their responses.

Players can text back a simple 'YES', 'NO' or 'MAYBE'--and even change their minds (before the RSVP deadline!). Managers can quickly see who's responded, whether they have enough for a game, and send reminders as needed.
